# 🧠 DSA Practice & Learning Repository  

> *"Code isn’t just about solving problems — it’s about sharpening the way you think."*  

Welcome to my **DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)** practice vault!  
This repository is a structured collection of problems I’ve solved while learning, revising, and improving my problem-solving skills in **C++**.

📘 Includes solutions from:
- LeetCode  
- GeeksforGeeks  
- Coding Ninjas  
- Striver’s DSA Sheet
